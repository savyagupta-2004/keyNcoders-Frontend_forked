                In January 2023, we noticed a striking trend: a surge in student
                enrollments in BCA and other tech-related degrees. However, a
                concerning statistic quickly came to our attention‚Äîonly about 1%
                of these students were successfully transitioning their
                education into viable careers. This discrepancy highlighted a
                significant gap that needed addressing. Driven by this insight,
                we embarked on a mission. From January 2023 to May 2024, we
                devoted ourselves to developing a solution. We meticulously
                researched over 50 colleges and engaged with more than 4,000
                students to understand their needs and challenges better. Our
                efforts culminated in the creation of keyNcoders‚Äîa comprehensive
                training and placement platform designed to bridge the gap
                between education and career success. Regardless of your
                background or the program you're enrolled in, we are here to be
                your dedicated partner in training and career placement. At
                keyNcoders, we are committed to transforming potential into
                achievement, ensuring that every student has the opportunity to
                turn their education into a successful career.

              Even with high enrollment in BCA and similar degrees across many
              local colleges in India, there‚Äôs a significant gap in helping
              students find good career opportunities. Many colleges have weak

              become job-ready. On the other hand, startups and companies also

              Nitish always envisioned an entrepreneurial path, driven by a
              desire to make a difference. Growing up in a tier 2 city, he
              recognized the challenges faced by aspiring tech professionals in
              his community. He noticed that many viewed BCA as just a degree
              with limited opportunities and a dead end after graduation, but he
              believed it could be so much more. Nitish thought, ‚ÄúWhy should
              people restrict themselves just for the sake of graduation? There
              are countless individuals from these backgrounds achieving great
              things in tech, so why not make it a viable option?‚Äù What was
              missing was a platform to train and guide these individuals,
              exposing them to the various paths they could explore in the tech
              industry with onsite placement opportunities. With a vision that
              transcends background and financial constraints, Nitish founded
              keyNcoders to support those who want to enter the tech field but
              can‚Äôt afford traditional engineering degrees. He also saw the need
              to address the lack of functional placement cells in local
              colleges, prompting him to create a space where aspiring tech
              enthusiasts could thrive and connect. Through keyNcoders, Nitish
              aims to empower individuals from all walks of life, providing them
              with the skills and support they need to succeed in
              the¬†tech¬†industry.
